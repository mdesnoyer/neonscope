# Neonscope

## Usage
- Install Stylish (Chrome Extension)
- Should put an S in your toolbar
- Click it, Manage Installed Styles
- Click, Write New Style
- Goto `style.css` and copy out the code
- Paste into Code Block in Stylish
- Call it Neonscope and click Save
- Close the Stylish window and hit www.discovery.com/videos/ (or similar)
- The Stylish icon should have a wee (1) on it AND you should see some crazy styling (similar to examples here)

## Caveats
- If the site also uses style properties the same as this is using, there might be a style fight and the results could be a bit wonky.
