1. Right click for Options and you can enter Username `global_admin_neon`, Password `4ERDWIlupafI` and Account Id (as per [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AxkS7q30UmNLFEYKfi4idXkcExqmRtCiFXipYbiqR50/edit#gid=0)).
1. Save (you might need to do it a few times, the Chrome UI is a bit flaky)
1. You can now turn on Neonscope for a page by clicking the button and turning it off (green = on, red = off, orange = thinking)
1. Once you see the images highlighted, you can click the SETTINGS
icon (small cog), see the thumbnails (and scroll through them, including, excluding) as well as Scores.
1. There is no UI, it is functional only. Please ask Ed for any further info.

## Troubleshooting

1. Sometimes when switching between tabs the extension stops working. Stop the extension (make it red), right click on it, `Manage Extensions`, find Neonscope in the list then click `Reload`. Then reenable the extension (click it, make it green).
